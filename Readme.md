"This project serves as my introduction to Databricks. The primary goal is to familiarize myself with the Databricks platform and its features.
I have uploaded data, created a storage container, and set up a cluster and workspace. 
Additionally, I configured the environment to enable the use of both code and SQL for data exploration and analysis."
